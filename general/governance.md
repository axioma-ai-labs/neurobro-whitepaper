# Governance

Neurobro is based on a transparent and community-driven governance model. Token holders play a critical role in shaping the projectâ€™s direction to ensure alignment with the interests of its ecosystem participants.&#x20;

**Governance mechanisms** will allow the community to vote on key decisions, such as:

* Allocation and use of the Dev Wallet
* Implementation of token burns and deflationary mechanisms
* Funding for marketing campaigns and ecosystem growth

The team is committed to maintaining open communication with the community on Telegram - and involve them in critical decisions. In addition, governance discussions will ensure that all changes align with the long-term sustainability of the project.

Future governance plans include a potential DAO model that will improve community participation and provide a structured approach to decision-making.&#x20;

By involving the community in the governance process - Neurobro not only ensures transparency but also strengthens its foundation for sustainable growth.

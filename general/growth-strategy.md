# Growth Strategy

The growth strategy for Neurobro is centered around two core pillars: **Innovation** and the **Community**.&#x20;

Unlike many projects that heavily rely on paid promotions or partnerships with influencers - Neurobro aims to prioritize organic community involvement and partnerships with aligned ecosystems.

Key aspects of the growth strategy include:

### **ðŸ”¸ Expansion Across Networks**

The team is actively exploring bridges to other blockchains to increase accessibility and liquidity for $BRO holders. Community members can expect a Solana bridge by the end of this year. By expanding beyond the Base chain - Neurobro intends to attract a broader audience and integrate into diverse ecosystems&#x20;

### **ðŸ”¸ Community-Led Marketing**

The marketing campaign focuses on empowering the Neurobro community to amplify the projectâ€™s reach. This includes engaging content, reward-based initiatives for contributors, and creating genuine collaborations with influential community members

### **ðŸ”¸ Revenue-Driven Buybacks**

The real-world revenue generated through Neurobroâ€™s technology will be partially allocated to token buybacks - which creates a deflationary effect. This strategy is expected to strengthen the tokenâ€™s price stability and long-term value

### **ðŸ”¸ Open Source**

To increase transparency, we release & fully open-source [Nevron](https://github.com/axioma-ai-labs/nevron) - the core framework written 100% in Python powering all the core Neurobro agents. By attracting the smarest developers we're planning to make Nevron a go-to AI agent framework in the entire space.

***

With these initiatives, Neurobro will establish itself as a leading AI agent in the crypto space - driving adoption and delivering consistent value to its ecosystem.

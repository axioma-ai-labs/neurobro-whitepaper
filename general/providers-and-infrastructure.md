# Providers & Infrastructure

Neurobro is built on a robust technological foundation developed over six months by **Axioma AI** in collaboration with **Crypto Hub**.&#x20;

The project combines state-of-the-art **multimodal AI integrations** with a proprietary agent infrastructure - which allows Neurobro to operate autonomously as a crypto research assistant and influencer.&#x20;

While the team is testing out the frameworks provided by Virtuals Protocol - Neurobro is not entirely dependent on external frameworks. The team has created its own advanced technology stack, which will enable seamless operation and flexible scalability.

The Neurobro platform already automates over 90% of the content pipeline - which encompasses research, analysis, text generation, video creation, posting, and community engagement. This level of automation ensures efficiency and consistency - and positions Neurobro as a leader in the AI agent space. Future updates aim to improve functionality, including expanded integrations with instant real-time data and real-world use cases, such as providing AI-powered services to businesses for internal and external operations.

By utilizing this advanced infrastructure - Neurobro is not only focused on delivering value to token holders but also on becoming a leading provider of AI solutions in the crypto ecosystem and beyond.

### ðŸ”¸ Transparent and Community-Driven

The **$BRO** tokenomics are built on a foundation of openness and shared decision-making.&#x20;

The Neurobro community plays a key role in shaping major decisions - including how the Dev Wallet is allocated and the long-term handling of team tokens.&#x20;

By putting these choices in the hands of token holders - Neurobro ensures a truly decentralized and equitable ecosystem.

### ðŸ”¸ Dev Wallet

**Address**: 0x73e65B34C82731b61B0bB6FB1509CC251500F832

The Dev Wallet is essential for funding the ongoing development and ecosystem expansion of Neurobro. The allocation of this wallet will be entirely guided by the community through a DAO model - ensuring maximum transparency.&#x20;

### ðŸ”¸ Team Allocations

* [**Axioma AI**](https://x.com/axioma_ai) **-** the technical powerhouse responsible for developing Neurobroâ€™s advanced AI systems and infrastructure
  * **Address**: 0x6777AaDBA6ebe5f6BAFee5C1bcfA46C4ED34B4b1
* [**Crypto Hub**](https://x.com/CryptoHub210) **-** the strategic partner providing insights, alignment, and marketing expertise to connect the ecosystem to its community and market
  * **Address**: 0xD8172350CD971164552AB50678B46Df26C002023

These wallets are dedicated to the two core teams behind **Neurobro.**

To maintain trust and alignment with the community - these allocations are structured with a **1-month cliff** post-launch, followed by a **12-month linear vesting schedule** through the [TeamFinance](https://www.team.finance/view-coin/0xc796E499CC8f599A2a8280825d8BdA92F7a895e0?name=Neurobro%20by%20Virtuals\&symbol=BRO\&chainid=0x2105). This ensures that the team remains committed to the projectâ€™s long-term success and delivers value to token holders without sudden sell-offs.

***

### ðŸ”¸ Fair Launch & Community Participation

The remaining supply of $BRO tokens was distributed via a **fair launch** on the [Virtuals Protocol](https://app.virtuals.io/), ensuring no unfair pre-sales or allocations to insiders. This approach guarantees equal opportunity for all participants to acquire tokens during the launch.

***

### ðŸ”¸ Future Use Cases & Revenue Integration

As part of Neurobroâ€™s comprehensive tokenomics strategy - up to **80% of on-chain revenue** and **30% of real-world revenue** generated by the projectâ€™s proprietary agent technology will be reinvested into **$BRO** through buy-back-and-burn mechanisms.&#x20;

This approach ensures that the success of the Neurobro ecosystem directly benefits token holders while supporting **deflationary** tokenomics over time.&#x20;

Neurobroâ€™s tokenomics model not only incentivizes long-term growth but also prioritizes the involvement and trust of its community.&#x20;

Together, the team and token holders are building a sustainable and impactful AI-powered ecosystem.

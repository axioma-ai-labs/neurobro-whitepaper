# Vision & Belief

### ðŸ”¸ Democratizing Crypto Insights

At Neurobro, our vision is to make high-quality crypto insights accessible to everyone - not just professional traders and insiders. We believe all users - regardless of background or experience - deserve fair access to **powerful tools** and **actionable crypto data**.

By building advanced **AI Agents** within the Neurobro ecosystem, we enable everyday traders and investors to receive complex crypto information in a clear, easy-to-understand format. We believe that access to high-quality insights empowers smart, informed decisions.

### ðŸ”¸ Community First

The heart of the Neurobro ecosystem is its community. The platform is designed to reward active supporters by redistributing **up to 80% of on-chain profits** and **up to 30% of real-world profits** through strategic **token-burning** and **token-buyback** mechanisms.

For further support of community members the **stacking** of $BRO will be introduced in the Q2 of 2025. Refer to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for further details on staking platform.

These mechanisms ensure that that every community member benefits from Neurobro's growth and success. For a comprehensive breakdown of the revenue sharing - see the [Tokenomics](tokonomics.md) section.

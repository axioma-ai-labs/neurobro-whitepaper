### **ðŸ”¸ Core Principles**

1. **Accessibility**\
   AI tools built for everyone, from casual learners to large enterprises.
2. **Transparency**\
   Open-source code and decision-making processes to foster trust and collaboration.
3. **Sustainability**\
   Balanced growth, focusing on long-term viability and community health.
4. **Decentralization**\
   Tools that reduce reliance on centralized entities, embracing blockchain and Web3.
5. **Collaboration**\
   Active engagement with a global community of developers and researchers.
6. **Ethical AI**\
   Systems that respect privacy, promote fairness, and align with human values.

***

### **ðŸ”¸ Key Features**

* **Autonomous Decision Making**\
  Uses a Q-learning algorithm for intelligent planning and action selection.
* **LLM Integration**\
  Compatible with a broad set of Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI).
* **Modular Workflows**\
  Predefined patterns for tasks like signal analysis or news research.
* **Memory Management**\
  Vector-based data storage (Chroma or Qdrant) for retaining and retrieving context.
* **External Integrations**\
  Seamless connections to Telegram, Twitter, Discord, and more.
* **Easy Deployment**\
  Run locally, with Docker, or on your preferred infrastructure.

***

### **ðŸ”¸ Core Modules**

1. **Planning Module**
   * Employs Q-learning for data-driven decision-making.
   * Configurable parameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate).
2. **Memory Module**
   * Stores and retrieves context with vector embeddings.
   * Supports multiple backends (Chroma, Qdrant).
3. **Feedback Module**
   * Processes action outcomes and updates the Q-learning model.
   * Tracks performance metrics to enhance future decisions.
4. **Tools**
   * Adapters and integrations for external services (Telegram, Twitter, research APIs).
   * Easily expandable with new tools.
5. **LLM Integration**
   * Empowers natural language understanding and generation.
   * Works with OpenAI (GPT-4o, text-embedding-3-small), Anthropic, and more.

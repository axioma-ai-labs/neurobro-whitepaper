## Milestones & Objectives

### **üî∏ Milestone 1: Expanded Workflows & Tools Integration**

**Estimate**: 4 weeks

* **Tool Integrations**:
  * Expand support for communication and productivity platforms, including Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Spotify, Shopify, YouTube, Google Drive, and Lens.
* **LLM Providers**:
  * Integrate new Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama, Gemma, and other open-source models for enhanced intelligence and adaptability.
* **Memory Providers**:
  * Add support for advanced vector stores, including Pinecone and Weaviate, to improve memory efficiency and configuration experience.

***

### **üî∏ Milestone 2: Planning Module Migration (Phase 1)**

**Estimate**: 2 weeks

* **Planning Module Upgrade**:
  * Transition from RL-based planning to advanced decision-making algorithms to enable greater flexibility and autonomy.
* **Decision Module Implementation**:
  * Develop logic for agents to dynamically combine tools and workflows.
  * Teach agents to adapt their workflows based on I/O operations from tools.
* **Real-Time Feedback System**:
  * Replace predefined workflows with flexible task-planning mechanisms.
  * Introduce feedback loops that allow agents to learn from outcomes and refine actions in real-time.

### **üî∏ Milestone 3: Planning Module Migration (Phase 2)**

**Estimate**: 3 weeks

* **Advanced Decision-Making Framework**:
  * Empower agents to self-organize tasks and autonomously select tools.
  * Introduce hierarchical task planning, allowing agents to manage subtasks and execute multi-step reasoning.
* **Migration Guide**:
  * Provide comprehensive documentation to guide developers through breaking changes introduced in this phase.
  * Ensure a smooth transition for existing implementations.

***

### **üî∏ Milestone 4: Security & Nevron Portal**

**Estimate**: 3 weeks

* **Nevron Portal Development**:
  * Develop a web-based and local GUI for agent configuration and deployment.
  * Provide intuitive, step-by-step guidance for setup and deployment.
* **Security Enhancements**:
  * Implement secure defaults for managing API tokens and keys.
  * Introduce user-defined access controls to limit agent permissions.
* **Hosting Options**:
  * Offer hosted deployment options for users without dedicated server infrastructure.

***

### **üî∏ Milestone 5: On-Chain Analysis Integration**

**Estimate**: 4 weeks

* **On-Chain Integrations**:
  * Add base-level support for querying data from blockchain platforms like Base, Solana, and others.
  * Extend functionality to enable agents to perform on-chain transactions.
